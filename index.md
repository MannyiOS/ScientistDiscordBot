## Welcome to the official documentation of the Scientist Discord Bot.

Quick disclaimer: No, this bot has nothing to do with actual science. In the future I may add commands that have science involved, but for now it's simply just a name.

Hello! If you're reading this then you're either curious about the production of this bot, or you would like to see what the commands for the bot are. To see the commands, just look under all this typing.
So, what is this bot for? Well, I'd like to code for a living out of highschool, and this is a good start to learning and having a simple website for documentation is also good. I will be updating this site with HTML and reposting the updated link in my Discord. Oh, and I'll probably add another section of the site for commands so it's cleaner looking.

### Different Commands!

Below you will see a list of commands that can be used for the bot, I will make sure to update the command list as I add commands.

Command list:
-ping, bot will reply with "pong!"
-rick, bot will reply with Rick Roll
```
