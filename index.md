## Welcome to the official documentation of the Scientist Discord Bot.

Quick disclaimer: No, this bot has nothing to do with actual science. In the future I may add commands that have science involved, but for now it's simply just a name.

Hello! If you're reading this then you're either curious about the production of this bot, or you would like to see what the commands for the bot are. To see the commands, just look under all this typing.
  
  So, what is this bot for? Well, I'd like to code for a living out of highschool, and coding something simple is a good way to start. Also, the site is really just to show improvments in the bot, if I make any other creations they will be posted on my GitHub or on another GitHub site, like this one.

### Different Commands!

Below you will see a list of commands that can be used for the bot, I will make sure to update the command list as I add commands.

```markdown
Command list:
-ping, bot will reply with "pong!"
-rick, bot will reply with Rick Roll
```
