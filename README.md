# ScientistDiscordBot
This will be for documentation and updates on my Discord bot.

What is Discord? Discord is a group-chatting platform originally built for gamers that has since become a general use platform for many kinds of communities. A cool edition to Discord
is the use of bots. You can add bots that have several different commands and uses. I decided as a side project I would code my own bot, as sort of a start to my software engineering résumé.
